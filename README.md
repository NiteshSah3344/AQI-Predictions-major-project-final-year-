# AQI Predictions(major project final year)
This repository is developed with the dedication of the team which is supposed to predict AQI for multiple cities of India(major) using regression models. Advanced technologies like mlops, mlflow, and GenAI has also been implemented to keep it different from traditional system and helps users assisting with their requirements in relevant field.

- Error handling and logging
- User interaction
- Pipeline coordination

## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Training Models
```python
from model_training import ModelTrainer

trainer = ModelTrainer()
trainer.train_all_models(X_train, y_train)
metrics = trainer.evaluate_all_models(X_test, y_test)
best_model, best_score = trainer.get_best_model()
```

### City-Specific Analysis
```python
from feature_engineering import prepare_city_specific_data
from anomaly_detection import detect_pollution_spikes_city

# Prepare city data
city_data = prepare_city_specific_data(train_df, val_df, test_df, "Delhi", features)

# Detect anomalies
anomaly_df, summary = detect_pollution_spikes_city(city_test_df, "Delhi")
```

### Visualization
```python
from visualization import AQIPlotter

plotter = AQIPlotter()
plotter.plot_forecast_with_risk_zones(forecast_df, "Delhi", "XGBoost")
plotter.plot_actual_vs_predicted(y_true, y_pred, "XGBoost", "Delhi")
```

### Model Persistence
```python
from model_persistence import ModelPersistence

persistence = ModelPersistence()
persistence.save_best_model(model, "xgboost", scaler, features, metrics)
artifacts = persistence.load_model_artifacts("best_model")
```

## 📊 Key Features

- **Modular Design**: Each module has a single responsibility
- **Time-Series Aware**: Proper temporal splitting and feature engineering
- **Multiple Models**: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Multiple metrics and forecast horizons
- **Anomaly Detection**: Rolling statistics and threshold-based alerts
- **Experiment Tracking**: Full MLflow integration
- **Production Ready**: Model serialization and deployment artifacts
- **Rich Visualization**: Professional plots with AQI risk categories

## 🔄 Migration from Monolithic

The original `model.py` (1407 lines) has been split into:

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| data_loader| Data operations |
| feature_engineering |Feature processing |
| model_training |Model training |
| model_evaluation |Evaluation metrics |
| visualization |Plotting functions |
| mlflow_utils |Experiment tracking |
| anomaly_detection | Anomaly detection |
| model_persistence |Model I/O |


**Total: ~2400 lines across 10 modules**

## 🎯 Benefits of Modular Architecture

1. **Maintainability**: Easier to modify individual components
2. **Testability**: Each module can be tested independently
3. **Reusability**: Modules can be imported and used separately
4. **Scalability**: New features can be added without affecting others
5. **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different modules
6. **Debugging**: Issues can be isolated to specific modules

## 📈 Performance

The modular system maintains the same performance as the original while providing:
- Better code organization
- Improved error handling
- Enhanced logging and monitoring
- Easier deployment and maintenance

## 🤝 Contributing

When adding new features:
1. Identify which module should contain the functionality
2. Follow the existing code patterns and naming conventions
3. Add appropriate error handling and logging
4. Update docstrings and comments
5. Test the changes thoroughly
